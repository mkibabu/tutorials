 # A deployment exercise

 # Here are the relevant contents of the 'hello.war' web app:

   WEB-INF/web.xml
   WEB-INF/classes/exercise1/Hi.class
   WEB-INF/classes/exercise1/Hi.java
   hi.jsp

 # The JSP script 'hi.jsp' uses two 'backend' POJOs:

   ## A java.util.Date instance     ### standard library class
   ## An exercise1.Hi instance      ### programmer-defined class

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Exercise 1</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <jsp:useBean id = "now" class = "java.util.Date" />    <!-- one POJO -->
  <jsp:useBean id = "hi"  class = "exercise1.Hi" />      <!-- another POJO -->
  <h3>
    <%= hi.getGreeting() + " at " + now %>
  </h3>
</body>
</html>

  # Here's the programmer-defined class:

package exercise1; 

public class Hi {
    public Hi() { }
    public String getGreeting() {
	return "Hello, world!";
    }
}

 # The exercise is to deploy the app:

   ### If you've time, you try might a completely manual deployment:
       put the right stuff in the right places in the WAR file.

   ### In any case, use my Ant script or your own Maven script to deploy.

   ### Test the deployment to ensure that it worked.
