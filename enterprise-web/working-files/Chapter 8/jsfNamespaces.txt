 -- JSF namespaces (old and new)

 # Here's the start of 'index.xhtml' in the 1st JSF web app:

    <html xmlns    = "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
          xmlns:h  = "http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
          xmlns:f  = "http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"
          xmlns:ui = "http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets">

   ## The namespace declarations in JSF are the counterparts of various page directives in JSP.

   ## Interpretation: 
                          namespace  localname
                                 \   /
       -- Recall that, in XML, 'foo:bar' is a 'qualified name', with a colon separating a
          namespace URI (or a 'proxy' for it) on the left and a local name on the right.

       -- A namespace proxy must be declared before it is used. 

          Example: the 1st entry (xmlns = ...) at the top declares 'xmlns' as shorthand for 
                   'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'. This makes 'xmlns' a namespace proxy.

       -- The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th entries above declare 'h', 'f', and 'ui' as proxies for
          the 'absolute URIs' to their right. (An 'absolute URI' is a URL.)
   
   ## The standard JSF proxies in HTML templates.

      Example: In the C2F web app, there's this HTML element in the 'index.xhtml' template:

        <h:panelGroup rendered = "#{c2F.show == true}">  <!-- Example of a qualified name using a namespace 'proxy' -->

      Of interest is the 'h:panelGroup' tag:

      -- 'h:panelGroup' is the 'qualified name' (qname for short)

      -- 'panelGroup' is the 'localname'.
          (Sometimes there's only the local name in HTML, e.g., in the tages '<p>' and '<html>'.)

      -- 'h' is the namespace identifier, in this case a declared proxy for 'http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html'.
