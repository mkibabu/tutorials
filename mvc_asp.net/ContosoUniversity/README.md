# Entity Framework 6 Code First using MVC

## Contoso University Web Application

Second ASP.NET tutorial.

Notes/insights gained from the tutorial can be found in the Notes file. The notes
reflect my understanding at the time the tutorial was done, and may therefore be
wrong/over-simplified. All attempts wil be made to correct misconceptions as I
learn more.
